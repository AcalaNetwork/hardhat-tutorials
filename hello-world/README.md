## About

This is a basic example on how to setup your Hardhat development environment as well as testing and
deployment configuration to be compatible with Acala EVM+. It contains a rudimentary
[HelloWorld](./contracts/HelloWorld.sol) smart contract and the required configurations and scripts
in order to test and deploy it.

## Setup an empty Hardhat project

Assuming you have your local tooling [ready to develop](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/setting-up-the-environment.html)
with Hardhat, we can jump right into creating a new Hardhat project.

1. Open a terminal window in a directory where you want your hello-world example to reside and
create a directory for it and then initialize a yarn project within it, as well as add Hardhat as a
development dependency, with the following commands:

```shell
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
yarn init --yes
yarn add --dev hardhat
```

2. Initialize a Hardhat project using:

```shell
yarn exec hardhat
```

3. When the Hardhat setup prompt appears, pick `Create an empty hardhat.config.js`, as we will be
configuring Harhdat manually:

```shell
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888

4. Add `ethers`, `waffle`, `chai` and `eth-providers` plugins with:

```shell
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @acala-network/eth-providers
```

## Configure Hardhat

Your `hardhat.config.js` should come with an example configuration, which we will be replacing, in
order to be able to use the local development network with Acala EVM+.

Import the `@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle` dependency into `hardhat.config.js`, by adding the following
line of code to the top of the config:

```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
```

Update the `solidity` version to `0.8.9`, as this is the version used in the example:

```js
solidity: "0.8.9"
```

Below the `solidity` configuration, let's add the network configuration, so that Hardhat will be
able to connect to our local Mandala development node:

```js
networks: {
  mandala: {
    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3330',
    accounts: {
      mnemonic: 'fox sight canyon orphan hotel grow hedgehog build bless august weather swarm',
      path: "m/44'/60'/0'/0",
    },
    chainId: 595
  },
}
```

Let's break this configuration down a bit:
- The port `3330` used in the node URL is the port provided by the
[ETH-RPC adapter](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/bodhi.js/tree/master/eth-rpc-adapter), which is
connected to our local development network.
- `mnemonic` used in the `accounts` section represents derivation mnemonic used to derive the
default development accounts of the local development network.
- `cahinId` of `595` is the default chain ID of the local development network.

This concludes the configuration of Hardhat. Now we can move on to the smart contract development.

<details>
    <summary>Your hardhat.config.js should look like this:</summary>

    require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

    /**
    * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
    */
    module.exports = {
        solidity: "0.8.9",
        networks: {
            mandala: {
            url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3330',
            accounts: {
                mnemonic: 'fox sight canyon orphan hotel grow hedgehog build bless august weather swarm',
                path: "m/44'/60'/0'/0",
            },
            chainId: 595,
            gasPrice: 429496729610000, // storage_limit = 100000, validUntil = 10000, 100000 << 32 | 10000
            },
        }
    };
</details>

## Add a smart contract

In this tutorial we will be adding a simple smart contract that only stores one value that we can
query: `Hello World!`. To do that, we have to create a directory called `contracts` and create a
`HelloWorld.sol` file within it:

```solidity
mkdir contracts && touch contracts/HelloWorld.sol
```

As the example is pretty simple, we won't be going into too much detail on how it is structured. We
are using Solidity version `0.8.9` and it contains a public `helloWorld` variable, to which we
assign the value `Hello World!`. It is important to set the visibility of this variable to public,
so that the compiler builds a getter function for it. The following code should be copy-pasted into
the `HelloWorld.sol`:

```solidity
pragma solidity =0.8.9;

contract HelloWorld{
    string public helloWorld = 'Hello World!';

    constructor() {}
}
```

Now that we have the smart contract ready, we have to compile it. For this, we will add the `build`
script to the `package.json`. To do this, we have to add `scripts` section to it. We will be using
Hardhat's compile functionality, so the `scripts` section should look like this:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "hardhat compile"
  }
```

When you run the `build` command using `yarn build`, the `artifacts` directory is created and it
contains the compiled smart contract.

## Add a test

To add a test, for the smart contract we just created, create a `test` directory and, within it, a
`HelloWorld.js` file:

```shell
mkdir test && touch test/HelloWorld.js
```

On the first line of the test, import the `expect` from `chai` dependency and
`calcEthereumTransactionParams` from `eth-providers`. We also set two constants to be used within
the tests:

```js
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { calcEthereumTransactionParams } = require("@acala-network/eth-providers");

const txFeePerGas = '199999946752';
const storageByteDeposit = '100000000000000';
```

We will be wrapping oru test within a `describe` block, so add it below the import statement:

```js
describe("HelloWorld contract", async function () {

});
```

Within the `describe` block, we set the `ethParams` from the `eth-providers` dependency (we won't be
using all of them, but they are added to the example for reference), then we first get the contract
factory and then deploy it. Once the smart contract is deployed, we can call the `helloWorld()`
function, that was automatically generated because we made the `helloWorld` variable public and
store the result. We compare that result to the `Hello World!` string and if everything is in order,
our test should pass. Adding these steps to the `describe` block, requires us to place them within
the `it` block, which we in turn place within the `describe` block:

```js
    it("returns the right value after the contract is deployed", async function () {
        const ethParams = calcEthereumTransactionParams({
                gasLimit: '2100001',
                validUntil: '360001',
                storageLimit: '64001',
                txFeePerGas,
                storageByteDeposit
        });

        const HelloWorld = await ethers.getContractFactory("HelloWorld");

        const instance = await HelloWorld.deploy();

        const value = await instance.helloWorld();

        expect(value).to.equal("Hello World!");
    });
```

With that, our test is ready to be run.

<details>
    <summary>Your test/HelloWorld.js should look like this:</summary>

    const { expect } = require("chai");
    const { calcEthereumTransactionParams } = require("@acala-network/eth-providers");

    const txFeePerGas = '199999946752';
    const storageByteDeposit = '100000000000000';

    describe("HelloWorld contract", async function () {
        it("returns the right value after the contract is deployed", async function () {
            const ethParams = calcEthereumTransactionParams({
                    gasLimit: '2100001',
                    validUntil: '360001',
                    storageLimit: '64001',
                    txFeePerGas,
                    storageByteDeposit
            });
            
            const HelloWorld = await ethers.getContractFactory("HelloWorld");
            
            const instance = await HelloWorld.deploy({
                    gasPrice: ethParams.txGasPrice
            });

            const value = await instance.helloWorld();

            expect(value).to.equal("Hello World!");
        });
    });

</details>

To be able to run the tests, we will add two additional scripts to the `package.json`. One to run
the test in the Hardhat's built-in network (this is a very fast option) and one to run the tests on
a local development network. This way you can verify the expected behaviour on Acala EVM+. Add these
two lines to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`:

```json
    "test": "hardhat test",
    "test-mandala": "hardhat test --network mandala"
```

As you can see, the `test-mandala` script differs from `test` script in the `--network` flag which
we use to tell Hardhat to use the `mandala` network configuration from `hardhat.config.js` that we
added in the beginning of this tutorial.

When you run the test with (for example) `yarn test`, your tests should pass with the following
output:

```shell
yarn test


yarn run v1.22.15
warning ../../../../../package.json: No license field
$ hardhat test


  HelloWorld contract
    ‚úì returns the right value after the contract is deployed (1558ms)


  1 passing (2s)

‚ú®  Done in 3.53s.
```

## Add a script

Finally let's add a script that deploys the example smart contract. To do this, we first have to add
a `scripts` directory and place `deploy.js` within it:

```shell
mkdir scripts && touch scripts/deploy.js
```

Within the `deploy.js` we will have the definition of main function called `main()` and then run it.
Above it, we add the import statement for `eth-providers` dependency as well as define `txFeePerGas`
and `storageByteDeposit` constants. These are used to be passed as transaction parameters. We do
this by placing the following code within the file:

```js
const { calcEthereumTransactionParams } = require("@acala-network/eth-providers");

const txFeePerGas = '199999946752';
const storageByteDeposit = '100000000000000';

async function main() {
    
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

At the beginning of the `main()` function definition we set the additional transaction parameters.
We won't be using all of them, but they are included, so you can reference them in future
development:

```js
  const ethParams = calcEthereumTransactionParams({
    gasLimit: '2100001',
    validUntil: '360001',
    storageLimit: '64001',
    txFeePerGas,
    storageByteDeposit
  });
```

Our deploy script will reside in the definition (`async function main()`). First we will get
the address of the account which will be used to deploy the smart contract. Then we get the
`HelloWorld.sol` to the contract factory and deploy it, while passing the transaction parameters
defined at the beginning of the `main()` funciton and assign the deployed smart contract to the
`instance` variable, which we ensure that is deployed. Assigning the `instance` variable is optional
and is only done, so that we can output the value returned by the `helloWorld()` getter to the
terminal. We do it by calling `helloWorld()` from instance and outputting the result using
`console.log()`:

```js
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

  const HelloWorld = await ethers.getContractFactory("HelloWorld");
  const instance = await HelloWorld.deploy({
    gasPrice: ethParams.txGasPrice
  });

  await instance.deployed();

  const value = await instance.helloWorld();

  console.log("Stored value:", value);
```

<details>
    <summary>Your script/deploy.js should look like this:</summary>

    const { calcEthereumTransactionParams } = require("@acala-network/eth-providers");

    const txFeePerGas = '199999946752';
    const storageByteDeposit = '100000000000000';

    async function main() {
      const ethParams = calcEthereumTransactionParams({
        gasLimit: '2100001',
        validUntil: '360001',
        storageLimit: '64001',
        txFeePerGas,
        storageByteDeposit
      });

      const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

      const HelloWorld = await ethers.getContractFactory("HelloWorld");
      const instance = await HelloWorld.deploy({
        gasPrice: ethParams.txGasPrice
      });

      await instance.deployed();

      const value = await instance.helloWorld();

      console.log("Stored value:", value);
    }

    main()
      .then(() => process.exit(0))
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
      });

</details>

All that is left to do, is update the `scripts` section in the `package.json` with the `deploy` and
`deploy-mandala` scripts. Once again, we are adding two scripts, so that we can deploy to the
built-in network as well as the local development network. To add theses two scripts to your
project, place the following two lines within `scripts` section of the `package.json`:

```json
    "deploy": "hardhat run scripts/deploy.js",
    "deploy-mandala": "TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=true hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mandala"
```

Running the `yarn deploy` script should return the following output:

```shell
yarn deploy


yarn run v1.22.15
warning ../../../../../package.json: No license field
$ hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
Stored value: Hello World!
‚ú®  Done in 7.81s.
```

## Summary

We have initiated an empty Hardhat project and configured it to work with Acala EVM+. We added a
`HelloWorld.sol` smart contract, that can be compiled using `yarn build`, and wrote tests for it,
which can be run using `yarn test` or `yarn test-mandala`. Additionally we added the deploy script,
that can be run using `yarn deploy` or `yarn deploy-mandala`.
