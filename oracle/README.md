# Acala EVM+ Hardhat Example: Oracle
This example introduces the use of Acala EVM+ predeployed Oracle. Note that unlike other examples that can run with local mandala, oracle can only run with public mandala, since there is no price feed for local mandala.

## Run
install deps
```
yarn
```

run tests
```
yarn test:mandalaPub
```
